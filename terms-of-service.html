                <h3>3.1 Consent and Opt-In</h3>
                <p>Our SMS messaging service operates on a <strong>double opt-in basis</strong>. When you call our
                    ordering line and request information to be sent via SMS:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Our system will first send you a consent request message.</li>
                    <li>You must reply "YES" to confirm your consent before receiving any additional messages.</li>
                    <li>Your consent is valid for 6 months. After that period, you will need to re-opt-in to continue
                        receiving SMS messages.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>By replying "YES" to our consent request, you expressly agree to receive SMS messages from
                        Juicy Burger related to your request.</strong></p>

                <p>You may opt out of SMS messages at any time by replying <strong>STOP</strong> to any message. After
                    opting out, you will receive a confirmation message and no further SMS messages will be sent unless
                    you opt in again.</p>

                <h3>3.5 Help</h3>
