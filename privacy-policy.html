                <h2>3. SMS Messaging and Consent</h2>

                <h3>3.1 Double Opt-In Process</h3>
                <p>Juicy Burger uses a <strong>double opt-in consent process</strong> for all SMS communications. Here's
                    how it works:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Initial Contact:</strong> When you call our phone ordering line (661-374-0660), our AI
                        voice assistant will help you with your request.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consent Request:</strong> If you request menu links, order confirmations, invoices, or
                        other information to be sent via SMS, our system will first send you a consent message asking
                        for your explicit permission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Explicit Consent:</strong> You must reply "YES" to the consent message before we send
                        any additional SMS messages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ongoing Communication:</strong> Only after you confirm consent will you receive the
                        requested information and any related order updates.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>3.2 Types of SMS Messages</h3>
                <p>With your consent, you may receive the following types of messages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Menu links and ordering information</li>
                    <li>Order confirmations and status updates</li>
                    <li>Invoices and receipts</li>
                    <li>Delivery notifications</li>
                    <li>Responses to your customer service inquiries</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.3 Message Frequency and Costs</h3>
                <p>Message frequency varies based on your interactions and requests. Standard message and data rates
                    from your mobile carrier may apply. You are responsible for any fees charged by your carrier.</p>

                <h3>3.4 Opting Out</h3>
                <p>You may opt out of SMS messages at any time by replying <strong>STOP</strong> to any message from us.
                    For help with our SMS service, reply <strong>HELP</strong> to any message.</p>

                <h3>3.5 Mobile Information Sharing</h3>
                <p><strong>No mobile information will be shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional
                        purposes. All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent;
