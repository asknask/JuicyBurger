# Juicy Burger - A2P 10DLC Compliance Landing Page

A standalone landing page with legal documentation created for A2P 10DLC campaign approval.

## Purpose

This project was built for a client (Juicy Burger LLC) who needed A2P 10DLC approval but wasn't equipped to manage website updates themselves. Rather than modifying their main site, we created this self-contained landing page with all required compliance elements for SMS messaging approval.

## What's Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `index.html` | Main landing page with phone CTA and SMS consent disclosure |
| `privacy-policy.html` | Full Privacy Policy with SMS consent section (Section 3) |
| `terms-of-service.html` | Terms of Service with SMS messaging terms |
| `styles.css` | Main styling (dark theme, warm colors) |
| `legal.css` | Legal pages styling |
| `hero-bg.png` | Background image for hero section |
